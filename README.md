ts3tools
========

Some small tools for the ts3 client query api. I may add some more if I'm bored.

###How to run
Install node.js and npm. Run `npm install ts3tools` and go to the `src/` directory.

###What is included
 
* Poke: `coffee poke.coffee "msg"` will poke everyone on the server with this message
* Move :`coffee move.coffee "name"` will move the person around randomly until he/she disconnects 
or until you stop the script. 
* Jail: `coffee jail.coffee "name"` will move the person to one channel over and over again. 
Channel id is hardcoded.

###Contribute
If you have something that fits in. Just send a PR. If you have ideas for a script, feel free to 
open an issue.
